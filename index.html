        <h3>About me</h3>
        <div class="column">
        <p>I graduated with actuarial science degree three yaers ago.
            i chose that field because i have always been interested 
            in mathematics and accounting. some members of my family 
            also convinced me it leads to better career options. 
            after graduating, i joined jubilee insurance company as
            an intern. i was at jubilee for a period of 1yr. i later
            got employed at DB Bank where my main role was to 
            analyse customer accounts for credit services.</p>

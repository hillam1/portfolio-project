        <h3>About me</h3>
        <p>I graduated with actuarial science degree three yaers ago.i chose that field because i have always been interested in mathematics and accounting. some members of my family also convinced me it leads to better career options. after graduating, i joined jubilee insurance company as an intern. i was at jubilee for a period of 1yr. i later got employed at DB Bank where my main role was to analyse customer accounts for credit services.</p>
        <p> as i worked at dn bank, i developed interest in IT, speciffically programming. as i was searching for a a good college to register for an IT course, i came asccross a friend who reffered me to moringa school and later joined the school. </p>
